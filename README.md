# Westwerk Dev Test Submission - Laura Abend

### Notes
- For better or worse, I opted to create this using WordPress which I started learning a little over a week ago. While it is not 100% complete, I do have most of the functionality in place as well as mobile-responsiveness.
- Because I made a plugin for the employees JSON file, I have committed that directory as well.
- I installed and started working with Grunt.js & SASS, but had to revert back to my original style.css in the interest of time (those are both new technologies for me as well).
- I could not get the employees plugin to show in correct order and that is why the 'Our Values' accordion follows it instead of the other way around.
- I use console.log() liberally when programming, but removed most of them for a cleaner submission.
- Finally - thank you for this opportunity, I learned a great deal!
